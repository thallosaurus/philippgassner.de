            About Me
        </h1>
        My name is Ril (or Rillo, whatever you like better) and I live in Bavaria, Germany. I am currently 23 years old and I was technically doing tech stuff since I was 7. Since then I was fascinated by computers and was always curious of how they worked. I could never make thought of how they even did something simple like basic math. This curiosity never really faded and so, I have set my goal to learn as much about computers as I can.

With such curiosity I have worked with several technologies just to understand how they work and how I can use them to solve problems in Informationprocessing as also how I can make computers and everything that makes a beep do whatever I want.

I like fast hard Techno Music and everything that makes weird sounds, danceable or not. You can follow my DJ Profile on Instagram: @djprismflux. Also be sure to checkout the Instagram page of our collective: @dirol_collective
